# Testing Strategy and Coverage Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for **LiveDocs** to ensure quality and reliability by achieving 100% functional coverage through automated testing approaches.

## Testing Objectives

- Guarantee application quality and reliability across all features
- Achieve comprehensive test coverage for all functionalities
- Ensure seamless user experience through automated validation
- Maintain code quality and prevent regressions
- Enable confident deployments and continuous integration

## Testing Types

### Unit Testing
- **Purpose:** Validate individual functions, hooks, and components in isolation
- **Scope:** Component logic, utility functions, custom hooks
- **Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library

### Integration Testing
- **Purpose:** Verify the interaction between multiple modules and components
- **Scope:** Component integration, API interactions, data flow
- **Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Purpose:** Simulate complete user workflows and application behavior
- **Scope:** Full user journeys, cross-browser compatibility, UI interactions
- **Framework:** Playwright

## Testing Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Jest** | Unit & Integration Testing | Test runner and assertion library |
| **React Testing Library** | Component Testing | React component testing utilities |
| **Playwright** | E2E & UI Automation | Browser automation and E2E testing |

## Test Coverage Scope

### Components Under Test
- **Header** - Navigation and user interface elements
- **ToolbarPlugin** - Document editing toolbar functionality
- **CollaborativeRoom** - Real-time collaboration features
- **Divider** - UI component functionality

### Custom Hooks
- **useActiveBlock** - Active block state management

### Actions & Services
- **getDocument** - Document retrieval operations
- **getClerkUsers** - User management and authentication

### Utilities
- **cn** - CSS class name utilities
- **$isTextNode** - Text node validation functions

### Pages
- **Document** - Main document interface and functionality

### UI Workflows
- **Navigation** - Application routing and page transitions
- **Editing** - Document creation and modification flows
- **Access Control** - Authentication and authorization flows
- **Rendering** - Component rendering and display logic

## CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Integration
- **Platforms:** Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions
- **Triggers:** Automated execution on every push and pull request
- **Reporting:** Coverage reports and failure notifications

### Automation Workflow
1. Code commit triggers pipeline
2. Unit and integration tests execute
3. E2E tests run in parallel environments
4. Coverage reports generated
5. Quality gates enforce minimum thresholds
6. Deployment proceeds on successful test completion

## Best Practices

### Test Quality Standards
- **Descriptive Naming:** Clear, descriptive test names and documentation
- **External Dependencies:** Proper mocking for external services and APIs
- **Test Organization:** Logical separation by test type and functionality
- **Continuous Maintenance:** Regular updates to tests with code changes

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Use meaningful assertions and error messages
- Implement proper test data management
- Follow consistent testing patterns across the codebase

## Test Execution

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Unit and Integration Tests
npx jest

# Run tests with coverage report
npx jest --coverage

# Watch mode for development
npx jest --watch

# End-to-End Tests
npx playwright test

# Run E2E tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.ts
```

### Test Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed"
  }
}
```

## Reporting and Metrics

### Coverage Reports
- Line coverage minimum: 80%
- Branch coverage minimum: 75%
- Function coverage minimum: 90%

### Test Metrics
- Test execution time tracking
- Flaky test identification and resolution
- Coverage trend analysis
- Failure rate monitoring

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test effectiveness
- Performance optimization of test suites
- Integration of new testing tools and methodologies
