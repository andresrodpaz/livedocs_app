# CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow** for **LiveDocs**. The automated pipeline ensures application quality and reliability through comprehensive testing, coverage analysis, and artifact generation on every code change.

## Workflow Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure all code changes maintain application quality standards
- **Automated Testing:** Execute comprehensive test suites without manual intervention
- **Coverage Monitoring:** Maintain minimum code coverage thresholds across all modules
- **Risk Mitigation:** Detect and prevent defects before deployment to production
- **Continuous Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback to development team on code quality

### Success Metrics
- **100% Pipeline Success Rate:** All critical pipeline steps must complete successfully
- **≥90% Code Coverage:** Maintain minimum coverage threshold across all components
- **Zero Critical Test Failures:** No critical path tests should fail in main branch
- **<10 minute Pipeline Duration:** Complete pipeline execution within performance targets
- **100% Artifact Generation:** All required reports and artifacts successfully created

## Pipeline Architecture

### Workflow Triggers

#### Automated Triggers
- **Push Events:** Triggered on pushes to `main` and `develop` branches
- **Pull Request Events:** Executed on all pull requests targeting `main` and `develop`
- **Scheduled Runs:** Optional nightly builds for comprehensive validation
- **Manual Triggers:** On-demand execution for testing and validation

#### Branch Strategy
```yaml
Trigger Branches:
├── main (production)          # Full pipeline with deployment gates
├── develop (staging)          # Full pipeline with integration testing
└── feature/* (development)    # Pull request validation only
```

### Pipeline Stages

#### Stage 1: Environment Setup and Preparation
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish consistent, reproducible build environment

#### Stage 2: Dependency Management
**Duration:** ~3 minutes  
**Purpose:** Install and cache project dependencies for optimal performance

#### Stage 3: Code Quality and Unit Testing
**Duration:** ~4 minutes  
**Purpose:** Validate code quality, business logic, and component functionality

#### Stage 4: Integration Testing
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Verify module interactions and API functionality

#### Stage 5: End-to-End Testing
**Duration:** ~8 minutes  
**Purpose:** Validate complete user workflows and cross-browser compatibility

#### Stage 6: Artifact Generation and Storage
**Duration:** ~1 minute  
**Purpose:** Generate and store test reports and coverage analysis

## Detailed Pipeline Flow

### Step 1: Source Code Checkout
**Action:** Repository code retrieval and workspace preparation

```yaml
- name: Checkout Repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for comprehensive analysis
```

**Validation:**
- Verify repository access and permissions
- Confirm branch and commit integrity
- Validate workspace initialization

### Step 2: Node.js Environment Configuration
**Action:** Establish consistent Node.js runtime environment

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js Environment
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'  # Enable dependency caching for performance
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `NODE_ENV: test` - Optimize for testing performance
- `CI: true` - Enable CI-specific behaviors
- `COVERAGE: true` - Enable comprehensive coverage collection

### Step 3: Dependency Installation and Caching
**Action:** Install project dependencies with optimized caching

```yaml
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm ci
  env:
    npm_config_cache: .npm
    npm_config_prefer_offline: true
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Utilize npm cache for faster installations
- Use `npm ci` for clean, reproducible installs
- Enable offline-first dependency resolution

### Step 4: Unit and Integration Testing Execution
**Action:** Execute comprehensive automated test suite with coverage analysis

```yaml
- name: Execute Test Suite
  run: npm run test -- --coverage --watchAll=false --passWithNoTests=false
  env:
    NODE_ENV: test
    JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR: ./test-results
    JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME: junit.xml
```

**Coverage Requirements:**
- **Line Coverage:** ≥90%
- **Branch Coverage:** ≥85%
- **Function Coverage:** ≥95%
- **Statement Coverage:** ≥90%

### Step 5: Coverage Report Artifact Generation
**Action:** Generate and store code coverage reports for analysis

```yaml
- name: Upload Coverage Artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: coverage-report-${{ github.run_number }}
    path: |
      coverage/
      test-results/
    retention-days: 30
```

**Generated Artifacts:**
- HTML coverage report with interactive drill-down
- XML coverage data for integration with external tools
- JSON coverage summary for programmatic analysis
- Test result XML for CI/CD integration

### Step 6: Playwright Browser Environment Setup
**Action:** Prepare browsers and dependencies for E2E testing

```yaml
- name: Install Playwright Browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps
  env:
    PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH: 0  # Use system-wide browser cache
```

**Browser Configuration:**
- **Chromium:** Latest stable version for primary testing
- **Firefox:** Latest stable version for cross-browser validation  
- **Webkit (Safari):** Latest available version for Safari compatibility
- **Mobile Browsers:** Android Chrome and Mobile Safari simulation

### Step 7: End-to-End Testing Execution
**Action:** Execute comprehensive user workflow and UI testing

```yaml
- name: Execute E2E Test Suite
  run: npx playwright test
  env:
    PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_REPORT: playwright-report
    PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME: e2e-results.xml
```

**E2E Test Categories:**
- **Authentication Flows:** Registration, login, logout scenarios
- **Document Management:** Creation, editing, deletion workflows
- **Collaborative Features:** Real-time editing, user presence, conflict resolution
- **Permission Systems:** Role-based access control validation
- **Error Handling:** Network failures, unauthorized access, invalid data
- **Performance:** Load times, responsiveness, concurrent user scenarios

### Step 8: E2E Report Artifact Generation
**Action:** Generate and store E2E testing reports and evidence

```yaml
- name: Upload E2E Test Artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()  # Upload artifacts even if tests fail
  with:
    name: playwright-report-${{ github.run_number }}
    path: |
      playwright-report/
      test-results/
    retention-days: 30
```

**E2E Artifacts Include:**
- Interactive HTML test report with screenshots
- Video recordings of test executions
- Browser traces for debugging failed tests
- Performance metrics and timing data
- Screenshot comparisons for visual regression testing

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Automated Quality Gates

#### Code Quality Gates
- **Linting:** ESLint rules must pass with zero errors
- **Type Checking:** TypeScript compilation must succeed without errors
- **Security:** npm audit must show no high or critical vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies:** All dependencies must be up-to-date and secure

#### Test Quality Gates
- **Unit Test Pass Rate:** 100% of unit tests must pass
- **Integration Test Pass Rate:** 100% of integration tests must pass
- **E2E Test Pass Rate:** ≥98% of E2E tests must pass (allowing for environmental flakiness)
- **Coverage Thresholds:** All coverage metrics must meet minimum requirements

#### Performance Gates
- **Build Time:** Application build must complete within 5 minutes
- **Test Execution Time:** Complete test suite must finish within 15
